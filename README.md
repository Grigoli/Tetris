<b>Description:</b> This project created windows game using c# windows forms. The game is called TETRIS that is puzzle game from the Soviet Union that tests your reflexes. Seven different shaped blocks fall down the game field one after the other. The object of the game is to keep the blocks from piling up to the top of the game field. To do this, player can move blocks to the left and right, and rotate them as they fall. If player can completely fill in one horizontal line, that line disappears and you get points. If the blocks pile up to the top of the game field, then that's the end of the game. TETRIS originally came from the word "tetra" meaning the number 4. By rearranging four squares, you can make seven different shapes which are the pieces used in this game.
